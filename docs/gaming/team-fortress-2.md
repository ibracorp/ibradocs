## Feature List

**Team Fortress 2 Dedicated Server Features:**

- Full Team Fortress 2 multiplayer server
- Support for up to 24+ players
- Custom map support
- MetaMod and SourceMod compatibility
- RCON remote administration
- Configurable game modes and settings

## Prerequisites

**System Requirements:**

- **CPU:** 4+ cores (2.0GHz or higher)
- **RAM:** 6GB minimum
- **Storage:** 10GB available space
- **Network:** Stable internet connection with port forwarding capability
- **Steam Account:** Required for server token generation

## Installation

### Unraid Docker Template

**Team Fortress 2 / ich777's Repository / Gaming**

**Installation Steps:**

1. Head to the Community Applications store in Unraid
2. Search for and click to install **Team Fortress 2** from **ich777's Repository**
3. If you are using a custom Docker network, select it in the 'Network Type' field
4. Enter the host port you want to map for the server. By default it is **27015**. Only change it if this port is already in use
5. **Generate Steam Token:**
   - Visit [Steam Token Generator](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers)
   - Log in with your Steam account
   - Create a new token for App ID **440** (Team Fortress 2)
   - Copy the generated token
6. **Configure Container:**
   - Paste your Steam token in the **STEAMTOKEN** field
   - Set **GAMEMODE** to your preferred game mode (e.g., cp, ctf, pl)
   - Configure **MAXPLAYERS** (default: 24)
7. Click Apply and wait for the container to pull down and start
8. **Port Forwarding:** Forward port **27015** (UDP/TCP) on your router to your Unraid server

### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  tf2-server:
    image: ich777/steamcmd:tf2
    container_name: tf2-server
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - STEAMTOKEN=YOUR_STEAM_TOKEN_HERE
      - GAMEMODE=cp
      - MAXPLAYERS=24
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
    ports:
      - "27015:27015/tcp"
      - "27015:27015/udp"
    volumes:
      - ./tf2-data:/serverdata/steamcmd/tf2
```

**Installation Steps:**

1. Save the above configuration as `docker-compose.yml`
2. Replace `YOUR_STEAM_TOKEN_HERE` with your Steam token
3. Start the container:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. Monitor logs for successful startup

## Configuration

**Server Setup Process:**

1. The server will automatically download Team Fortress 2 files on first startup
2. Wait for the download to complete (this may take 15-30 minutes)
3. Once complete, your server will be available at `YOUR_SERVER_IP:27015`
4. Players can connect using the console command: `connect YOUR_SERVER_IP:27015`

**Server Customization:**

- **Configuration Files:** Located in `/serverdata/steamcmd/tf2/tf/cfg/`
- **Custom Maps:** Place in `/serverdata/steamcmd/tf2/tf/maps/`
- **Server Settings:** Edit `server.cfg` for advanced configuration

## Server Modification

### Adding Custom Maps

1. Access your server files through Unraid shares or container console
2. Navigate to `/serverdata/steamcmd/tf2/tf/maps/`
3. Upload your custom map files (`.bsp` format)
4. Restart the server or use RCON to change maps

### MetaMod & SourceMod Installation

**MetaMod Setup:**
1. Download MetaMod from [official website](https://www.sourcemm.net/)
2. Extract files to `/serverdata/steamcmd/tf2/tf/`
3. Add `"metamod"` to your `gameinfo.txt`

**SourceMod Setup:**
1. Download SourceMod from [official website](https://www.sourcemod.net/)
2. Extract files to `/serverdata/steamcmd/tf2/tf/`
3. Restart server to load plugins

## Configuration Options

### Server Settings

| Setting | Description | Default | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `GAMEMODE` | Game mode type | `cp` | `cp`, `ctf`, `pl`, `koth` |
| `MAXPLAYERS` | Maximum players | `24` | `16`, `32` |
| `STEAMTOKEN` | Steam server token | Required | Generated from Steam |
| `HOSTNAME` | Server name | `TF2 Server` | `My TF2 Server` |

### Advanced Configuration

Edit `server.cfg` for advanced settings:

```cfg
// Server name
hostname "My Team Fortress 2 Server"

// RCON password
rcon_password "your_secure_password"

// Server password (leave empty for public)
sv_password ""

// Game settings
mp_timelimit 30
mp_maxrounds 5
tf_weapon_criticals 1
```

## FAQs

### How do I host a private server?

Set a server password in your configuration:
```cfg
sv_password "your_password"
```

### How do I change the server name?

Edit the `hostname` setting in `server.cfg`:
```cfg
hostname "Your Server Name Here"
```

### How do I set an RCON password?

Add the following to `server.cfg`:
```cfg
rcon_password "your_secure_rcon_password"
```

### Server not visible in browser?

1. Ensure port **27015** is forwarded properly
2. Check your Steam token is valid and properly configured
3. Verify the server is running without errors in the logs
4. Make sure `sv_lan 0` is set in your configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server Won't Start:**
- Verify Steam token is correct for App ID 440
- Check available disk space (minimum 10GB)
- Review container logs for error messages

**Players Can't Connect:**
- Confirm port forwarding is configured correctly
- Check firewall settings on router and server
- Ensure server is not set to LAN mode (`sv_lan 0`)

**Performance Issues:**
- Monitor CPU and RAM usage
- Reduce maximum players if experiencing lag
- Consider upgrading server hardware

### Log Analysis

```bash
# View container logs
docker logs tf2-server

# Follow logs in real-time
docker logs -f tf2-server
```
